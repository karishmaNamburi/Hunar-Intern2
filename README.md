Before performing any data analysis or training machine learning models, it is essential to clean the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. One of the key steps in data preprocessing is removing null values (i.e., missing or empty entries). Null values can occur due to data entry errors, system glitches, or incomplete data collection. If not handled, they can lead to incorrect results or cause algorithms to fail. Another important step is eliminating duplicate records, which are rows that contain exactly the same values across all columns. Duplicate entries can skew the analysis by over-representing certain data points, leading to biased or misleading outcomes. In data cleaning, null values and duplicates are typically removed using functions provided by data processing libraries such as Pandas in Python. This helps ensure the dataset is consistent, accurate, and ready for meaningful analysis or model training.
